reset location permissons with: 
C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe shell pm reset-permissions

if location doesn't work in emulator startup google maps once, and reinstall the app
   Still doesn't fully work in the emulator for me, but works fine on real phone.

TODO:

* redirect to the youtube video in the youtube app, on click in results
* load youtube video title into app, from the youtube app
* store some settings 
* fill in searchbar, on click search history item


* cleanup code
* optimize api calls (scrolling causes an excessive amount of api calls)
